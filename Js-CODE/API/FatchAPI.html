// API : API stand for Application Programming Interface
// Suppose We are sit in Restronent and we call the watter
// give him some order for food in that case water take your order and after some time he placed you order. 
// Same as Api do that it  takes your request and after some times  it return your requested data

Befour calling the Api see some examle

// fetch API
 The Fetch API provides an interface for fatching (Sending/ Receiving) resources
 and fetch API uses Request and Response object internally

 fetch() method is use to send and recive the data
  syntax
     let promise = fatch(url, [options])
     when we write the url(link) inside the fatch method our code automatically send the request on that link 
     and fatch method return the promise
when we fatch data from any url through api(it may be food api.....)it return data in different formate
so we cant read.
now we have to understant why we not get the proper data from api when we send get request from url through js
 
AJAX :- is Asynchronous js and xmal
Earlyer when we fatch data through Api . data comes in xml formate

JSON :-  is Javascript object Notation
Now when we fatch data through Api . data comes in JSON formate(Means it return data like javascript object forment)

// Process when we call API
  s1- When we send the request to Api . API return some responce and this responce in JSON formate
  s2- Now we have to convert this response JSON to Javascript object and we use to json() methord  for converting these response.
