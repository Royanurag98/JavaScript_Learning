                                       VARIABLE IN JAVASCRIPT.
Variables are Containers for Storing Data in other word we can say that Variable is the name of a memory location where we stores some data. 
=>The Value of variable can be changed.
=>The name of variable is always meaningful .
         Like  age =56;

Note
>JavaScript provide a future
The value of a JavaScript variable can be changed during the execution of a program . (if we store a string in a variable we can also store number, array, object in same variable) that is called dynamically typed language.
example
           let m=5;
           console.log(m);
           m="Anurag";
           console.log(m);
 


>Dynamic typing means we can change the type of variable in runtime.
>Static typing means first we need to declare the type of variable like int , float ,char etc.
>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
                let x;         // Now x is undefined
                x = 5;         // Now x is a Number
                x = "John";    // Now x is a String
                console.log(x);
                console.log(typeof(x));


>There are specific rules we must follow while naming a variable:
=> Variables are case sensitive. Means small and capital varible name  both are different variable.
=> A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore [_]. and $ sign only. But first character of a variable name must be alphabet or underscores(_) and $ sign .
=> White spaces and comma cannot be used.
=> The name should not be reserved keyword.

>JAVASCRIPT NAMING CONVENTIONS
    =>camelCase (used in JS)
    =>PascalCase (used in JS)
    =>snake_case

=>camelCase naming convention we use in JavaScript for  Variable , Booleans, Functions, Methods 
=>PascalCase naming convention we use in JavaScript for Class, Components
=>Snake_case naming convention we use in JavaScript  for Constants

>Declaration  of variable in JavaScript.
let myName;
let myAge;

>initialization  of variable in JavaScript.
myName =”Anurag”;
myAge = 22;

>Declaration and initialization  of variable in JavaScript.
Let myName = “Anurag”;
Let myAge = 22;


>In JavaScript we can create a variable with the help of three Keyword
         =>var     Keyword
         =>let     Keyword
         =>conct   Keyword
>NOTE
=> Now we are not use var keyword because var is a part of old JavaScript. var is used in ECMA Script (ES 5) and earlyer version.
=> Now we are use let and const keyword because let and const is a part of new JavaScript.
let and const keyword introduce ECMA Script 6(ES6)

>var keyword:- 
If we declare a variable from var keyword. then we can also re-declare  the variable with the same name of variable and also re-assign the value(value of variable may or may not be same data type) in the same name of variable.
var myName="Anurag";// Declare and initialized  with var keyword 
var myName="Priti"; //  Re- declare and re-initialize with same variable name 
myName="Kavita";    //Re-assign the value. in same variable name(Update)
console.log(myName);

>let keyword:-
If we declare a variable from let keyword . then we can’t  re-declare the variable with the same name of variable but  re-assign the value(value of variable may or may not be same data type) in the same name of variable.
let myName="Anurag";// Declare and initialized   with let keyword
let myName="Priti"; //  Can not re- declare with same name of variable 
myName="Kavita";    //Re-assign the value. in same variable name(Update)
console.log(myName);
 
>Const:- 
If we declare a variable with const keyword. then  neither re-declare the variable with same name of variable nor re-again with the its value in same name of  variable.
const myName="Anurag";// Declare and initialized   with const keyword
const myName="Priti"; //  Can not re- declare with same name of variable 
myName="Kavita";    // Can not Re-assign the value. in same variable name(Update)
console.log(myName);

2. Var is globally scoped while let and const are blocked scoped.
3. var and let initialized with undefined whereas const variable are not Initialized with undefined.
var age; // initialized with undefined
let name;// initialized with undefined
const x; // we can’t initialized with undefined
document.write(age,name)

const must be initialized during the declaration of  const.
