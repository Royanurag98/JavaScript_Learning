                            JAVASCRIPT OBJECT
JavaScript objects is  just a collection of properties(key and value of object is called properties) 
and methods(Behaviour or function). Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object except primitives datatype. but we can make an object of primitive datatype with the help of new keyword.

But numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
           let y = new Number(123);
Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects

primitives datatype are(string ,number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint)
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods and Primitive values are immutable (it can not be changed)
if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14. 3.14 naver be 3.8
// Some point about object
  1. We can Nasting the object.
  2. Object is dynamic nature means we can modefy(Update, delete, add object properties) the object in runtime.
  3. If you create a normal variable with const keyword we can not update the value of variable but
     If you create object with const keyword we can redecleare one by one the object properties because object is reference datatype. 
     we cant update all properties of object array at once
     example
     const arr =[2,3,4,5,6]
     arr[0]=7;// we can reassingn indivisually
     arr=[2,4,6,7,8]// but we can not reassign at once
     const obj={
            // These are object Properties
                "First_Name":"Anurag",//String
                "Last_Name" :"Kumar", //String
                 "Age"      : 24,     // Number
                 "Course"   :"MCA",   // String
                 "Skills":["C", "C++","JavaScript","HTML","CSS","ReactJs"], //Array
                 "Indial"   :"yes", // boolean
                 
               // Method or Behaviour of object
                  "greatMe" :function(){ /// Function
                  document.write("Good Morning how are you")
                  }
               
            }

Creating an object in javascript.
three way to create object in javascript
1. By object literal
2. By creating an instance of object directly(Using new keyword)
3. By using an object constructor(using new keyword).

1. By object literal : it is way to create an object. in this way all the key value pairs written inside
the curly brackets and seperated by samicolon.
like 
   const obj ={                         Note:
                                            key is always string but value may be different data type. 
         "Name":"Anurag", 
         "Id": 5678577,
         "Roll_Num":67
   };
Note
prototype is a special properties which is inside the every javascript object
type of prototype is bacilly a refernce of an object
When We crete the object. a prototype object is automatically created by the browser
and inside the prototype object lots of properties and mathord
sometime we use some method for performaing some task with object like tostring().
these to string method inherited from the prototype object.

another example
Suppose we crete a array like
  let arr=["mango","Banan","orange"];
  and we want to add one fruit inside the array we use pop() method . this pop() is
   bacilly inherited from prototype object.
