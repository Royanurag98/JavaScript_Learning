                                     Sync and Async in Js ?
Synchronous :
Synchronous  means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. 
each instruction waits for previous instruction to complete its execution. 

In other words
Meaning of synchronous  programming is suppose you write a multiple line of instruction in your program 
in a sequence . in that case all lines of code run one by one and second lines of code waits for the previous 
line when previous line of code is executed now control of execution jump to the next line. 
 
Note : JavaScript is also synchronous programming language or single threaded

Async in js
Due to synchronous programming sometimes important instruction get blocked due to some previous instruction , 
which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous programming allow us to execute next instruction immediately 
and dose not block the flow of code

Other Word
Suppose we write a 5 line of instruction in program. And unfortunately  3rd   line  instruction take some time
for execution. In that case  Asynchronous programming   allow us to execute next instruction immediately so all
 line of instructions run one by one and also 3rd line of instruction execute parley . when it execute print 
 whatever written  in 3rd instruction.

setTimeout() execute a function according to user . means When the user want to execute that function.we have
to pass the time inside thesetTimeout() function

Callback
A function which is passed inside the another function as an argument. that is called callback.
