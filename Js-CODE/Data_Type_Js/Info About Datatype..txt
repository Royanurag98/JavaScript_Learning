Data type in Js

Primitive Data-type                                  Non Primitive Data-type
(NN BB SS U)
> Null                                                               > Object
> Number                                                             > Array
> Boolean
> BigInt
> String
> Symbol
> Undefined

Note :
=> When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
     let Number= 36;                   Output 
     let Name  = "Anurag";               36Anurag         
     console.log(Number+Name);

=> JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:
     let x = 16 + 4 + "Anurag"               20Anurag
     let x = "Anurag"+16 + 4 ;               Anurag164
     console.log(x);                         
> All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
> Javascript numbers are always one type:  double (64-bit floating point).

Question
> Crete a variable of type string and try to add a number to it?
> Use typeof operator to find the data type of string in last question?
> Crete a const object in JavaScript can you changed it to hold a number later?
> Try to add a new key to the const object in problem 3 were you able to do it?
> Write a js program to create a word – meaning dictionary of 5 words?
